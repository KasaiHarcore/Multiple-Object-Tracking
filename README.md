## Introduction
This repo contains a collections of pluggable state-of-the-art multi-object trackers for object detection. For the methods using appearance description, with collaboration of state-of-the-art ([DEEPSORT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00763)) and ([YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com)) models. The main idea I got from ([here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.7618.pdf)). I'm only use this to test on vehicle, for another type of tracking, you have to modify the code.
